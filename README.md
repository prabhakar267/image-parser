# Image Parser
Image Parser (or Image Extractor) is a web-application which extracts all the images on any public URL.
You just need to enter the name (URL) of the website and you get all the images which are visible on that page.

It works for almost all of websites and extracts all the images (**except the images in CSS files**).

Same can be done as an API. You simply need to provide the url of the page you want to extract as parameter and you will get the URLs of all the images as a JSON Array as response.
